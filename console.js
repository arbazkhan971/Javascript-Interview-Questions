// The console object provides access to the browserâ€™s debugging console. 
// The specifics of how it works vary from browser to browser, but there is a de facto set of features that are typically provided.
// For any developer, console.log() is one of the most well-known javascript functions since it allows us to quickly check for errors in our code in some circumstances.

/* 
The most common Console methods:
- console.assert() 
- console.clear()
- console.count()
- console.dir()
- console.group() and console.groupEnd()
- console.table()
- console.time() and console.timeEnd()
- Custom CSS styles for a console.log()
